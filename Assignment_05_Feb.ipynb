Encapsulation helps in maintaining data integrity and preventing unauthorized access.\\n\\n2:_  Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism that allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class).

Polymorphism simplifies code and promotes flexibility and extensibility.\\n\\n4:-  Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential characteristics while hiding irrelevant details.
