    "In Python, both for loops and while loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements. The choice between a for loop and a while loop depends on the specific requirements of the problem that you are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Loops:\n",
    "For loops are used when you know the number of iterations beforehand. A for loop iterates over a sequence of elements, such as a list or a range of numbers, and executes the same block of code for each element in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10:\n",
    "for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "In this example, the for loop iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 10. The range function generates a sequence of numbers from the start value to the end value (exclusive),\n",
    "and the for loop iterates over each number in the sequence. The current number is stored in the variable i, and the block of code inside the for loop is executed for each value of i.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Loops:\n",
    "While loops are used when you do not know the number of iterations beforehand. A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. The loop stops when the condition becomes false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10:\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i <= 10:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, the while loop checks the condition i <= 10 at the start of each iteration. \n",
    "If the condition is true, the block of code inside the while loop is executed and the value of i is incremented by 1. \n",
    "The loop continues to execute until the condition i <= 10 becomes false."
